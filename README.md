# Pistol-Whip-Ricochet-Mod

- This mod allows your bullets to bounce off of walls and surfaces!

### Notes:
- This mod will make the in-game accuracy rating think that you missed more than you actually did. This should only affect scores in deadshot mode, but if you're going for a high-accuracy run you can temporarily disable this mod in /Pistol Whip/userData.
