# Pistol-Whip-Ricochet-Mod

- This mod allows your bullets to bounce off of walls and surfaces!

### Notes:
- In deadshot mode, using this mod will likely lower your score. If you're going for a high-score run on deadeye, you can temporarily disable this mod in ```/Pistol Whip/userData/modprefs.ini```. 
  - This is because even if you land a bounced bullet, the initial shot was still a miss.
